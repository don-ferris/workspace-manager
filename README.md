# workspace-manager
Quickly switch between named workspaces (xfce)

If you like to have dedicated/defined/single purpose workspaces for different tasks (email (multiple accounts), python dev, web dev, car search, etc.) which task is assigned to which workspace number can get a little confusing unless you have a great memory. workspace-manager displays a list of (up to 12) workspace buttons (with keyboard shortcuts), each labeled with the task associated with that workspace to allow you to quickly switch between workspaces by clicking the appropriate button or pressing the associated keyboard shortcut.

Assign a keyboard shortcut to ws-mgr to quickly launch it, then click a button or press alt+[underlined letter on button] to immediately switch to the associated workspace.
