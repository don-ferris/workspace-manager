# workspace-manager
BASH/Zenity script for quickly switching between, adding, and renaming Xfce workspaces

Workspaces are great for compartmentalizing and reducing distractions. If you like to have dedicated/defined/single purpose workspaces for different tasks (email, development, shopping, car search, etc.), which task is assigned to which workspace number can get a little confusing unless you have a great memory. workspace-manager displays a list of your workspaces (up to 12 with keyboard shortcuts), each labeled with the associated task for that workspace. This allows you to quickly switch between workspaces by clicking the appropriate button or pressing the first letter of the workspace name.

I recommend assigning a keyboard shortcut to wsmgr to quickly launch it, then click a button or press the first letter of the workspace name to switch to the associated workspace. (If there's more than one workspace that starts with the same letter, the up and down arrows on your keyboard will get you to the next one quickly.)

NOTE: This probably would have been easier using xdotool but I wanted to learn from this project.
